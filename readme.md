## Notes

### Positioning - Relative and Absolute

- When a position of an element is set to either relative or absolute, we can use the top, bottom, left, and right properties to move the element from its original position.

- When the position is set to relative, The element will be placed relative to the document's normal flow. If the element is moved from its original position, the space is still reserved for the element.

- When the position is set to absolute, The element will be placed relative to the nearest positioned ancestor. If there is no positioned ancestor, the element will be placed relative to the initial containing block.

The element will be removed from the normal flow and the space will not be reserved for the element.
